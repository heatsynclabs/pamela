Imagine some very elaborate description on what this is, but I fail in finding
the right words right now. It is a very cool way to visualize any kind of data,
for example people being present in the same physical location. 
Currently it comes with an example scanner that scans the local network for mac
addresses and displays them in a very nice 3d HTML 5 canvas thing. Enough with
the words, look at the installation in hsbxl and whitespace:

Installation
============

* Copy all the files in a directory that is hosted by a webserver, e.g. apache
* Your webserver must naturally support php
* The php-sqlite3 extension must be installed


Configuration
=============

* Edit the config.php to configure Pamela
* Make sure the configuration of where the database will be is a writable 
  directory, a database will be created there automatically using the name you
  specified.

Scanner details
===============

You can upload data to the webinterface by posting a comma separted list to the
upload.php page. This is done using application/x-www-form-urlencoded format,
with the key beying "data" and the value being a comma separated list of items.

e.g. using wget:

wget http://host/pamela/upload.php -O - --post-data data=comma,separated,list,of,items
